# FOREST-FIRE-PREDICTION


Forest fires are a major environmental issue, creating economical and ecological damage while endangering human lives. Fast detection is a key element for controlling such phenomenon. To achieve this, one alternative is to use automatic tools based on local sensors, such as provided by meteorological stations. In effect, meteorological conditions (e.g. temperature, wind) are known to influence forest fires and several fire indexes, such as the forest Fire Weather Index (FWI), use such data.

Through the analysis of intricate patterns in meteorological and environmental data, machine learning provides strong tools for forest fire prediction. Six machine learning models—Random Forest, Neural Networks, Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)—were used in this study, and their performances were compared.

The three types of machine learning approaches are reinforcement learning, unsupervised learning, and supervised learning. For regression problems, where the objective is to forecast a continuous target variable, such fire intensity or area burned, supervised learning is essential. The link between independent variables (such temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation) and dependent variables (like the occurrence or spread of fire) is examined by regression models. While more sophisticated approaches like Random Forest and XGBoost capture intricate, non-linear relationships in the data, linear regression, one of the most basic regression techniques, provides a baseline for comparison. Neural networks have the potential to model complex dependencies due to their capacity to learn hierarchical representations, but they must be carefully adjusted to prevent overfitting. Additional viewpoints are offered by SVR and Decision Trees, which strike a balance between predictability and simplicity.

Numerous environmental characteristics, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation, are included in the dataset that was used. The prediction accuracy of each model was assessed using key performance indicators, such as root Mean squared error (RMSE)mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R 2-score.
